                <p>If you're experiencing an infinite loading screen, you have a bug with BCML. It's an easy enough fix, but it may take a couple of tries to clear it up.</p>

                    <li>Delete your BCML Merged Folder, Win+R and type <p class="code-box">%localappdata%\bcml</p> to find the folder.</li>

                    <li>Enter <p class="code-box">pip uninstall bcml --yes</p></li>
                    <li>Enter <p class="code-box">pip install bcml==3.10.4</p></li>
                    <li>Open bcml and remerge your mods</li>
                    <li>Launch and play your game, if the issue persists start again at step 1 until it clears up</li>

        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content"><div class="content-centerer">
            <p>As of right now Second wind SHOULD work with DtgA if placed lower in priority than DtgA mods. However, things change a lot in DtgA and sometimes new inconsistencies can be introduced. If you are experiencing issues it is recommended to turn this mod off for now and see if your issues go away.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content"><div class="content-centerer">
            <p>No, DtgA is not compatible with the switch or the original wii U hardware, you need BCML and Cemu to make DtgA work at all.</p>
