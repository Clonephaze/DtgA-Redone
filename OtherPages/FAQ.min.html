It's an easy enough fix though!</p><ol><li>First things first, ensure you have the ReBorn module installed with a higher priority than the ReAnimated module. This is <b>REQUIRED</b>.</li><li>If ReBorn is lower down, enable the drag handles with the button in the bottom left of bcml that looks like 3 of the same length lines.</li><li>Drag ReBorn above ReAnimated, but keep it below Collision Actors like all DtgA modules shoud be.</li><li>Confirm your changes and let BCML do its thing. When it's done, launch and play your game.</li><li>If you still have an issue, unisntall and reinstall the ReBorn module fresh and try again.
